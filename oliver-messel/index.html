                  The Oliver Messel Collection consists of around 10,000
                  individual items and has been housed by the V&amp;A Theatre
                  Collections since 1981. The collection was originally on loan
                  from Lord Snowdon, Messelâs nephew, who inherited the
                  collection on his uncleâs death in 1978. In 1983 the V&amp;A
                  held a major exhibition using the Messel collection as the
                  source material and including many objects on loan from his
                  family, friends and work colleagues, including his sister Anne
                  (Lady Rosse) and his nephew, Thomas Messel.

                  In 2005, with the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund, the
                  Friends of the V&amp;A and the National Art Collections Fund,
                  the V&amp;A Theatre Collections purchased the collection from
                  Lord Snowdon. Under the funding agreement, the V&amp;A
                  established a touring interactive display using the collection
                  as an inspiration. The Museum also staged a conference held at
                  the Theatre Museum where V&amp;A curators and Messelâs nephew,
                  Thomas, gave papers on Messelâs legacy as an interior, film
                  and stage designer.

                <h2>Oliver Messel (1904 â 1978)</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>âI attempted to use every device to make as much magic as
                    possibleâ. Oliver Messel.</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Oliver Messel was the leading British stage designer of the
                  mid-twentieth century. He was born on 13 January 1904 to Maud
                  Frances (1875 â 1960) (daughter of the Punch cartoonist Edward
                  Linley Sambourne (1844 â 1953) and Lieutenant-Colonel Leonard
                  Charles Rudolph Messel (1872 â 1953), a successful banker.
                  Messel began his fifty-year career in 1925 and won
                  international acclaim for his exquisite taste and mastery of
                  period style in revues, plays, films, interiors, buildings,
                  musicals, operas and ballets, becoming one of the most
                  sought-after and highly-paid scenery and costume designers of
                  his era.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Messel was a master of illusion and make-believe; from his
                  early childhood he made model houses, furniture and painted
                  maquettes. He could make a chandelier out of sticky paper and
                  fuse-wire, or construct a dancerâs head-dress out of pipe
                  cleaners. His nephew, Lord Snowdon, remembers as a child
                  finding a birdâs nest in his London garden and on inspection
                  discovering that it had been made by his uncle Oliver, and
                  that the eggs were made of hand-painted china.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Messel was a perfectionist who knew exactly how fabric should
                  be cut and how every stage prop should be made. He often
                  demanded items be remade if they were not to his satisfaction.
                  He worked with every major theatre director of his generation
                  and received a CBE in 1958. He designed nine films throughout
                  his career, each displaying his intrinsic knowledge and
                  research for period detail and his flair for creative
                  inventiveness.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    âOliver made a white dress for me with a blue sash worn like
                    a halter, which he made from a wonderful material called
                    lisse, which is finer than organza. He had a sharp eye for
                    what you were and never overdressed me. He made me look like
                    a million dollarsâ. Eyelyn Laye
                    <strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Messel had trained as a painter at the Slade School of Art
                  where his contemporaries included Rex Whistler (1905 â 1944).
                  His formal studies concentrated on life drawing and painting,
                  but he also made masks from papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and wax for student
                  events. An exhibition of his masks at the Claridge Galleries
                  in London in 1925 led to his first stage commission to design
                  masks for the prestigious Diaghilev ballet production of
                  ZÃ©phyre et Flore, performed at the London Coliseum. From 1926
                  onwards, Charles B. Cochran engaged Messel to design costumes,
                  masks and sets for his annual reviews at the London Pavilion.
                  These reviews consisted of songs, sketches and chorus numbers,
                  and provided Messel with ample opportunities to develop and
                  exercise his talent for minute attention to detail, inventive
                  use of materials and imaginative pastiche of historical
                  periods and styles. This would become Messelâs trademark in
                  whatever medium he worked.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1932, Messelâs white-on-white set and costume designs for
                  Helen, an opera bouffe with music by Jacques Offenbach,
                  directed by Max Reinhardt, caused a sensation on the London
                  stage. The production cemented his success and secured a
                  steady stream of prestigious London theatre design commissions
                  from the 1930s to the 1960s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was Messelâs work on Helen and the 1932 production of Max
                  Reinhardtâs wordless medieval play The Miracle that brought
                  him to the attention of film director and producer, Alexander
                  Korda. Korda was founder of London Films and Denham Film
                  studios in Buckinghamshire. He was a figurehead in the
                  fledgling British film industry and was the first film
                  director to be knighted. Messelâs first film for Korda was The
                  Private Life of Don Juan, which starred Douglas Fairbanks. It
                  was during Messelâs second film for Korda, The Scarlet
                  Pimpernel, starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon, that
                  Messel really explored the pastiching of a historical period â
                  in this case the late eighteenth century. Messel was hired
                  especially to design costumes for Oberon, who would later
                  become Kordaâs wife. The film is a romantic adventure set
                  during the French Revolution with a supporting cast including
                  Raymond Massey and Nigel Bruce. The costumes for Oberon were
                  daringly low-cut but very flattering. Messel used picture hats
                  to frame Oberonâs dark features. They were fanciful and
                  fairylike versions of the Regency period style of dress and
                  this approach to designing and creating costumes would become
                  Messelâs own distinctive style over the next thirty years.

                <h2>Romeo and Juliet (1936)</h2>
                <p>
                  Messelâs next film project took him to Hollywood and gave him
                  the resources of a major film studio with which to realise his
                  designs in a historical film. In 1935, the Hollywood film
                  studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer was planning a production of
                  William Shakespeareâs Romeo and Juliet. Irving Thalberg was
                  Head of Production at MGM and wanted a high profile production
                  for his wife, Norma Shearer, who had been off the screen for a
                  year, having given birth to their second child. Shearer was
                  one of the most popular stars at MGM during the 1930s and she
                  had first choice of any major film the studio was planning to
                  produce. Irving, along with Chief Executive Louis B. Mayer,
                  had established MGM as the most powerful film studio in the
                  world with the famous tag line âmore stars than there are in
                  heavenâ. The studio was synonymous with lavish glossy
                  musicals, drawing-room comedies and high quality literary
                  adaptations. For Shearerâs return to the screen, two high
                  profile historical projects were considered: Romeo and Juliet
                  and Marie Antoinette. Louis B. Mayer, felt the âmassesâ were
                  not ready for Shakespeare, but script problems on Marie
                  Antoinette delayed the production so Romeo and Juliet was
                  given the green light with a budget of $1,000, 000 dollars. In
                  1935, this was the most expensive MGM production to date.
                  George Cukor, who had recently scored a hit with a screen
                  version of David Copperfield, was hired to direct.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cukor was keen for a fresh look for the film, setting it in
                  mid-Renaissance Italy. Having seen Messelâs work for The
                  Miracle in New York, he arranged for screenings of The Scarlet
                  Pimpernel and The Private Life of Don Juan for Irving Thalberg
                  and Norma Shearer. Cukor felt Messelâs costumes for Merle
                  Oberon were ornate but casual and captured the essence of the
                  period.

                <p>
                  As well as actors, writers and directors, MGM had two of the
                  most creative individuals in the history of the Hollywood
                  studio system under contract, Cedric Gibbons and Gilbert
                  Adrian (often credited on films as âGowns by Adrianâ). As Head
                  of the Art Department, Cedric Gibbons was known for his Art
                  Deco-styled set designs; his loathing of wallpapered sets gave
                  MGM productions a distinct, modern, unfussy âhouse
                  styleâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                  Gibbons stipulated in his contract a clause that his name was
                  put to every MGM production, regardless of whether he designed
                  it or not. Messelâs arrival from England to design the film
                  caused some initial tension at the studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once Messel was formally engaged on the production, he was
                  dispatched with a camera crew to Italy where he spent three
                  months recording almost 3,000 photos of buildings, squares,
                  balconies, paintings, frescos and drawings. He studied the
                  paintings of Botticelli, Bellini, Carpaccio, Ghirlandaio and
                  Piero della Francesca. Gozzoliâs painting Procession of the
                  Magi, was used as an inspiration to fashion all the costumes
                  for the entrance of the Prince of Verona and his followers at
                  the beginning of the film. Norma Shearerâs costumes were
                  inspired by Fra Angelicoâs painting The Annunciation and her
                  ball gown was adapted from Michele da Veronayâs The Betrothal.
                  The level of research undertaken by Messel for the film is
                  evident in the collection held at the V&amp;A, with hundreds
                  of photographs detailing every aspect of Italian imagery that
                  would inspire the design for the film.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once back in Hollywood, Messel discovered that the studioâs
                  principal costume designer, Gilbert Adrian, had already
                  designed all the costumes, but used his charm to complete what
                  he had been hired to do. The costumes in the finished film can
                  be matched with the costume designs that are held in the
                  archive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The shoot lasted 108 days and the set covered five acres of
                  sound stages. The set department created a near reconstruction
                  of Piazza San Zeno in Verona. Romeo and Juliet was one of the
                  most intricate costuming operations in MGMâs history, with
                  more than 1,200 costumes produced for the film on which 500
                  people worked for two months. Several looms were set up in Los
                  Angeles and two mills were engaged in New York to weave tights
                  all in one piece. A total of 18,000 yards of cotton, silk,
                  satin, velvet and wool went into the costumes for the extras
                  employed to portray crowds of townspeople, soldiers and
                  nobles. One of Leslie Howardâs cloaks for Romeo used nine
                  yards of Fortuny cloth imported from Italy. Norma Shearerâs
                  costumes required one hundred yards of assorted silks, satins
                  and other materials, all hand-embroidered or beaded to
                  reproduce, as closely as possible, the embroidery of the time.
                  The âJuliet skull capâ worn by Norma Shearer was a fashion hit
                  with audiences of the period. During his stay in Hollywood,
                  Messel discovered Dozianâs, a shop in Los Angeles that sold,
                  in his words, âevery kind of material ever madeâ. He bought
                  yards of unpatterned fabric, which was then hand-painted and
                  stitched in the MGM workrooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The famous balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet was reshot three
                  times at Thalbergâs insistence (he watched the daily rushes of
                  all the films he supervised at MGM) in close-up, medium and
                  long shot and the set occupied 52,000 square feet of sound
                  stage. Many of Messelâs characteristic design motifs that he
                  would use throughout his career are visually evident in the
                  film: in the Capuletsâ ball scene, for example, where Romeo
                  first spots Juliet, ornate flowered garlands hang around the
                  high arched walls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Norma Shearer employed the English theatre actress Constance
                  Collier on the set to coach her verse delivery. Shearer, not a
                  trained actress, was extremely nervous of taking on such a
                  classical role. Her anxiety, however, was compensated with
                  generally good reviews for her performance and an Academy
                  Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was also nominated
                  in the following categories: Best Supporting Actor (Basil
                  Rathbone), Art Direction (Cedric Gibbons) and Best Film
                  (Irving Thalberg). Nevertheless, Romeo and Juliet made a loss
                  at the box office, although the studio felt that films of this
                  quality added to MGMâs prestige. Producer Irving Thalberg died
                  ten days after the Los Angeles premiere of Romeo and Juliet;
                  he was thirty-seven years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Watching the film today, the sets alternate between Messelâs
                  romantic interiors and Gibbonsâs solid, geometric rooms, and
                  the film generally lacks a certain passion, with the emotion
                  of many scenes underplayed. This is possibly due to the period
                  in which it was conceived. Later in his film career, George
                  Cukor stated that out of all his films, this was one to which
                  he would have liked to return.

                  In 1944, Messel began work on a film version of George Bernard
                  Shawâs stage play Caesar and Cleopatra. The production was
                  directed by Gabriel Pascal, who became the only director
                  trusted by Shaw to film his plays after successful film
                  versions of Pygmalion in 1938 and Major Barbara in 1941.

                  The film starred Claude Rains as Caesar, Vivien Leigh as
                  Cleopatra, Stewart Granger as Apollodorus and a host of strong
                  English character actors in supporting roles. The production
                  was filmed in Technicolor, and remains the only full
                  production designed by Messel that displays his design work in
                  colour.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                  He was engaged to design costumes, props and interior
                  decoration (sets for the film were by John Bryan) and in this
                  production his talent and skill for creating objects from
                  everyday items and transforming them into something ârealâ for
                  the screen displays his versatility and creativeness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the Second World War, Messel had been stationed in
                  Norwich as Camouflage Officer and it was Messelâs experience
                  of designing camouflage which would be used again in designing
                  Caesar and Cleopatra. Under the conditions of wartime Britain,
                  with strict rationing in place and many shops closing down,
                  materials required for the film were not readily available.
                  Therefore, Messel had to extend the âmake do and mendâ ethos
                  of wartime Britain into the filmâs design. Many of the props
                  required had to be created using what was freely available.
                  Authentic-looking antique Egyptian jewelry was created from
                  thin wire, plastic, cellophane and bits of glass. Gold plates
                  and ornaments were made from a combination of gilded leather
                  and papier-mÃ¢chÃ©. Many of the costumes were contrived from
                  Indian saris, obtained from some of the large department
                  stores in London which where still functioning. Costume-making
                  workshops were also badly understaffed due to the essential
                  dressmaking workforce having left London due to bombing or on
                  war service.

                  Interiors, decorative hangings and bedspreads were printed in
                  hand-blocked Egyptian and Persian designs, curtains of
                  coupon-free gauze were stencilled with authentic patterns of
                  the period in specially mixed dyes. Messelâs assistants on the
                  film included Eleanor Abbey, Margaret Furse, Beatrice Dawson,
                  Arthur Boys and Matilda Etches, and the small production team
                  worked extremely long hours to sew individual replica jewels
                  onto the costumes. Messel designed the fringed bed hangings in
                  Cleopatraâs bedroom. For the feathered fans used by
                  Cleopatraâs handmaidens in the music room scene, he borrowed
                  some of the large fans from the Messel family home, Nymans, in
                  Sussex (these are now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).

                  Messelâs assistants were adept interpreters of Messelâs
                  artistic intentions. Hugh Skillan, who designed and created
                  many headdresses for the ballerina Margot Fonteyn, also worked
                  on the headdresses required. Materials used on one of the wigs
                  for Vivien Leigh as Cleopatra include leather, wax, wire,
                  acetate, glass, beads and paint. Finally, over 2,000 costumes
                  were created for the production.

                  Caesar and Cleopatra was shot under extremely difficult
                  conditions, beginning on 12 June 1944, six days after the
                  D-Day landings. The director Gabriel Pascal wrote to George
                  Bernard Shaw on 22 June 1944 and told him:

                  âLast Saturday, I had a narrow escape on the Pharos set which
                  is built out of doors on the studio lot, when a flying bomb
                  landed and exploded 150 yards from the set in a nearby field.
                  Last night the French windows in my sitting-room were blown in
                  and the ceiling in my bedroom has cracked open completely. I

                  Shaw took a keen interest on almost every level of the film,
                  down to the smallest detail. Below is a sample of
                  correspondence between the two during the film:

                <p>
                  <strong>1 July 1944</strong> : George Bernard Shaw wrote to
                  Gabriel Pascal about one of the characters costumes:<br>
                  âBritannus is so hopelessly wrong that he will hold up all the
                  scenes in which he appears until he is redressed. I enclose a
                  suggestion of what he should look like. He must have an
                  academic gown.â
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>8 July 1944</strong> : Pascal to Shaw:&nbsp;<br>
                  âI have discarded the original costume and have had a long
                  gown made for him. His wig I have had remade with red hair, as
                  you suggest, and a new moustache, turning down.â
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>9 July 1944</strong> : Shaw to Pascal:&nbsp;<br>
                  âBritannusâs must be mainly in blue, the shepherdâs plaid is
                  only for the tunic, that is why the blue overall should be an
                  academic gown, opening all at the front [sic]. They have
                  plenty of things in Oxford still.â
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>23 July 1944</strong> : Pascal to Shaw:&nbsp;<br>
                  âI made a new costume, a new wig, and a new moustache for
                  Britannus and am sending you photos of his costume and
                  make-up. The costume is now a lovely cornflower blue.â
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>26 July 1944</strong> : Shaw to Pascal:&nbsp;<br>
                  âBrittanusâs costume is alright now but his moustache is
                  hopeless. He must have Dundreary whiskers â yellow whiskers.â
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shawâs letter was accompanied by a water-colour sketch of
                  Britannusâs head.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>

                  The sets for the film which complemented Messelâs interior
                  decoration and costumes were by John Bryan, who had designed
                  Pygmalion and Major Barbara. The ancient Memphis Palace, to
                  which Cleopatra brings Caesar after their encounter at the
                  Sphinx, was the largest interior created for the film. It
                  occupied 28, 000 square feet of floor space and each of its
                  pseudo-granite columns measured nineteen feet in diameter.

                <p>
                  A twenty-seven-foot-high mini-Sphinx was created for the film,
                  and when the crew moved to Egypt for exterior shots, the
                  Sphinx was dismantled and shipped over. Once filming was
                  completed the Sphinx was left in the desert to save money on
                  transportation, where it became a photographic background for
                  tourists.

                  The final cost of Caesar and Cleopatra was Â£1.3 million, the
                  most costly production at that point in British film
                  history.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                  The film is a testament to Messelâs resourceful and creative
                  inventiveness, working under extraordinarily difficult
                  circumstances and the ability of his team of makers and
                  assistants to interpret his designs into objects than could be
                  âreadâ in cinematic terms.

                  The film version of Alexander Pushkinâs
                  <em>The Queen of Spades</em> is one in a long line of classic
                  British supernatural thrillers such as
                  <em>Dead of Night</em> (1945) and
                  <em>The Innocents</em> (1961). The story is set in 1806 in St
                  Petersburg and is a Faustian tale of bargains with the devil
                  and ghostly apparitions. The film was directed by Thorold
                  Dickinson, who took over the production at only three days
                  notice. Messel was hired to design the sets and costumes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the outset the production was fraught with difficulties
                  and it was not until the film was completed that it emerged as
                  one of Dickinsonâs finest films, with Messelâs contribution to
                  the work helping to create one of the most famous British
                  supernatural-themed films of the 1940s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The production was filmed at Welwyn Garden City, in
                  out-of-date, cramped and badly soundproofed studios. They were
                  situated next to the main railway line so that shooting had to
                  be halted every time a train passed by. The lack of space
                  added to Messelâs headaches but he insisted on designing and
                  building the Countessâs stage coach to full size and not to
                  scale so that it could not be moved more than ten feet in
                  either direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The budget ran out before the film was completed and Dickinson
                  was forced to improvise with some sets which were constantly
                  being torn down and replaced with new ones. In addition, he
                  was working with two performers who had never made films
                  before, Edith Evans and Yvonne Mitchell (although Edith Evans
                  had made a number of silent films, it was her first âtalkingâ
                  picture). They both found it difficult to adjust to the
                  demands of the camera after their experience on the stage.
                  Edith Evans for example, had been advised by Alec Guiness to
                  let the camera do all the work and so she underplayed
                  drastically and had to be coaxed into expanding her
                  performance. Yvonne Mitchell tended to give her best
                  performance during the first take and found herself unable to
                  repeat her initial performance in subsequent takes. The script
                  underwent numerous changes throughout the production; the
                  original prologue of the film became a flashback, and
                  sequences were cut or transposed, frequently being shot with
                  no real idea of what order they would finally appear in. Under
                  these conditions Dickinson rose to the challenge and was
                  spurred on in inventing visual techniques to drive the story
                  forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dickinson created a number of superb sequences in which he
                  uses suggestion to create terror. The visit of the young
                  Countess to the palace of St Germain is worthy of the great
                  English horror director James Whale (Frankenstein, The Bride
                  of Frankenstein). Once at the palace, the camera follows the
                  Countess down the cobwebbed corridor until she comes to a huge
                  door, which opens to reveal a gaping blackness beyond.
                  Messelâs set design for this sequence created the suggestive
                  and eerie atmosphere that Dickinson was able to replicate on
                  film.

                  The lighting of the film adds considerably to the atmosphere.
                  It was predominantly low-key, creating some striking
                  chiaroscuro effects, and brilliantly captures the Messel
                  interiors.The cinematographer was Otto Heller, whose films
                  included <em>The Ladykillers</em> (1955),
                  <em>Peeping Tom</em> (1960) and <em>Victim</em> (1961). Heller
                  used a series of wide-angle lenses to suggest space and width
                  where they did not exist, particularly in a key ballroom
                  scene, where camera trickery was used to deceive the eye. The
                  vertiginous high-angle shot of the young Countessâs arrival at
                  the palace of St Germain was created because they could not
                  afford to build the palace faÃ§ade. Instead, they created the
                  effect by putting up a corner of a wall with a gargoyle on it,
                  directing lights to give the appearance of an open door and
                  then shooting down onto the carriage. Point-of-view shots were
                  used constantly to disguise the fact that many sets were
                  either small or half-built, or in some cases non-existent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dickinson often used shots of visual symbolism, common in the
                  silent film era and used by Alfred Hitchcock in almost all of
                  his films. One such key moment is when the Countess, now armed
                  with the secret of the cards, goes to the gambling house. As
                  she flings her crucifix onto a transparent glass table so that
                  it dominates the frame, Dickinson places the camera underneath
                  the table focusing not only on the crucifix being used as a
                  gambling tool, but the ceiling above her head which depicts
                  two huge claws that will now symbolically consume her soul for
                  the remainder of the film.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mirrors are a recurring motif in the film: characters look at
                  themselves at crucial points and their actions are also
                  frequently seen reflected in mirrors. Such devices provide a
                  visual unity to the film which plays creatively off the sets,
                  the movement of the camera and angle of the camerawork.

                  The scope of Messelâs design in the film is apparent from the
                  set and costume designs held in the V&amp;A collection. Every
                  prop and period detail had been researched meticulously and
                  parts of the set design had a twist. Scenes in the palace of
                  the old Countess had to look as if they had remained unchanged
                  for fifty years. The gilded, rococo elaboration of her state
                  apartments had to appear mellowed under dust and patina; the
                  vaulted hallway and great staircases within her palace also
                  had to strike a sombre note. The squalor of the serfs had to
                  be represented as did many exteriors, including a bird market
                  and a carriage crossing a bridge, which were all filmed
                  indoors.

                  When the film opened in June 1949, it received universal
                  praise from the critics. Dilys Powell wrote in The Sunday

                  A young Ken Adam was a production draughtsman on the film. He
                  would go on to design many of the James Bond films,
                  <em>Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang</em> (1968) and
                  <em>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love
                    the Bomb</em>

                  At the end of 1950 The Royal Opera House in London presented
                  its first ever production of Tchaikovskyâs
                  <em>The Queen of Spades</em>, directed by Michael Benthall. As
                  Messel had designed the film, he was the obvious choice for
                  the opera version. For the most significant scene, when the
                  Countess dies, Messel created a masterly conception: he placed

                  Messelâs last film was based on Tennessee Williamsâs stage
                  play <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em>. The film was directed by
                  Joseph L. Mankiewicz from a screenplay by Gore Vidal with an
                  all-star cast in the leading roles â Katharine Hepburn,
                  Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor. Filmed in Shepperton
                  Studios near London, Messelâs sub- tropical deep-south jungle
                  set for Mrs Venablesâ house, with its larger than life exotic
                  garden containing huge and menacing plants, was reminiscent in
                  style of his exterior stage settings for The Little Hut, Ring
                  Round the Moon and The House of Flowers. The garden became the
                  main set piece where many key scenes take place, creating an
                  essentially claustrophobic and over-powering presence in the
                  film.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Messelâs research into capturing the New Orleans French
                  Quarter atmosphere was as extensive as always. Images of
                  buildings, balconies, squares, gates, and, for the
                  extraordinary garden, photographs of prehistoric forests and
                  plants, are all contained in the V&amp;A collection.Messel
                  once again engaged Hugh Skillan to assist him on the film.
                  Skillan had worked with Messel since 1942; his headdresses
                  were so light and excellent in construction that artists found
                  them comfortable to wear. Skillan worked on making the
                  insect-eating plants and out-sized exotic foliage. Messel made
                  banana leaves with waxed crinkle paper and then mixed them
                  with real plants; he also made vines from paper twisted round
                  in coils and then covered with pale green flock. Over seventy
                  different varieties of plants were used on the set and mixed
                  with a painted backdrop; the effect was that of a monstrous
                  jungle.

                <p>
                  In one scene which takes place in Sebastianâs studio, Messel
                  has placed masks from his 1920s reviews on the desk and on the
                  walls. Among the set designs for Suddenly, Last Summer are
                  more mundane sketches and ground plans for corridors, offices
                  for the hospital in which Elizabeth Taylorâs character is
                  being held and exteriors for the fictional location, Cabeza de
                  Lobo. The extraordinary baroque lift in which Katharine
                  Hepburn descends for her first entrance was created with John
                  Claridge, who assisted Messel on many projects including the
                  Dorchester Hotel suite created in 1953.

                  Winning Messel an Academy Award nomination for set and
                  costumes design, <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em> would be his
                  last film. His successful working relationship with Elizabeth
                  Taylor led Twentieth Century Fox to commission him to design
                  her costumes and wigs for their forthcoming mammoth production
                  of <em>Cleopatra</em>, but this had an unhappy end for Messel
                  because his designs were never used and he was replaced on the
                  production by Irene Sharaff who would win an Academy Award for
                  her work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the mid-1960s, Messel moved to Barbados and began designing
                  homes there and for the adjacent island, Mustique (including a
                  villa for HRH The Princess Margaret). His work as an architect
                  would again reflect his inventive use of materials: for his
                  own house he made use of local coral stone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Messelâs creative ingenuity was evident throughout his career
                  in whatever medium he worked. For students of art, design,
                  performance and film, access to this unique collection at the
                  V&amp;A and the availability of his film work on DVD gives new
                  insight into the working practices and techniques of one of
                  Britainâs most talented and accomplished stage designers.

                        At the beginning of 1939, Messel co-designed costumes
                        for the Alexander Korda epic
