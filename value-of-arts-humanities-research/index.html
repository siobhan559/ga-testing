                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  Arts and Humanities research directly informs the key
                  activities of a national museum like the Victoria and Albert
                  Museum (V&amp;A). The Museum serves as an international centre
                  of excellence in the fields of the history of art and design,
                  conservation, learning and interpretation and contemporary
                  creative practice, and its programmes benefit from research
                  that is designed to contribute both to the public
                  understanding and experience of its collections, and to the
                  methodological and theoretical advancement of relevant arts
                  and humanities disciplines. The V&amp;A therefore fosters a
                  proactive research culture, both in developing public outcomes
                  that are underpinned by current scholarship (its galleries,
                  high-profile exhibitions, publications, conferences and
                  website) and in fostering collaborations with academic
                  partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a frequent recipient of Arts and Humanities Research
                  Council and other research grants the V&amp;A is well
                  practiced in recognising and capitalising on opportunities to
                  enhance the value of its activities and outputs through
                  ambitious, authoritative and accessible research programmes.
                  This essay will discuss recent examples of externally-funded
                  projects at the V&amp;A where innovative object, collections,
                  exhibitions and archive-based research has made a demonstrable
                  and positive impact on both specialist knowledge and the
                  quality of the visitor experience, stimulating debate on past
                  and present cultures, and encouraging new approaches to
                  scholarship and the dissemination of expertise in the UK and
                  beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much recent debate on the value of the public arts sector
                  (including museums and galleries) has focused on its
                  measurable contribution to the national economy via the
                  creative industries, tourism and a vibrant art market, and to
                  the quality of life of individuals and communities. It is
                  certainly the case that the UKâs museums play an important
                  role in raising social capital, encouraging inclusion and
                  kick-starting urban regeneration. Less has been said however,
                  on the ways in which the practice of Arts and Humanities
                  research underpins these initiatives, particularly in the
                  context of the museum exhibition and display. The following
                  case-studies demonstrate the significant impact that such
                  research activities can make via the public presentation of
                  the nationâs material and cultural assets.
                </p>
                <h3>i. Object-led research</h3>
                <p>
                  The most distinctive feature of museum-based research is that
                  it is based on objects. Prompted by artefacts from the past,
                  museums have traditionally tended to ask very focused
                  questions about dating, authorship, manufacture, and usage.
                  While this approach was once seen as conservative by
                  academics, in recent years the idea that objects should be
                  given priority â that they should determine the course of
                  research, rather than serving as data â has become more and
                  more accepted. Indeed, many observers agree that there has
                  been a âmaterial turnâ in fields such as anthropology, social
                  history, and even literary studies, comparable to the
                  much-discussed âlinguistic turnâ that occurred in the
                  humanities some thirty years ago. The shift towards
                  materiality has encouraged museum professionals and academic
                  researchers to work together more closely than ever before,
                  particularly in the UK. This has been beneficial to all
                  concerned. UK-based museum curators have broadened the range
                  of questions that they ask of their collections, and the focus
                  on objects has similarly transformed the methods and goals of
                  scholarly research and learning in the British higher
                  education sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are multiple advantages to be gained by placing objects
                  at the centre of a collaborative research project, rather than
                  in the margins. First and foremost, artefacts exert friction
                  on the researcher. General theories are invariably tested by
                  the specificity and concreteness of objects, which rarely
                  conform to expectation. Partly for this reason, object-led
                  research is fundamentally interdisciplinary. Fully accounting
                  for the research potential of even a single object might
                  require contributions by historians of art, culture, science,
                  and economics as well as specialists in conservation and other
                  scientific disciplines.

                  Take, for example, the decorated beer mug inscribed â1701â.
                  Such an object can be studied, first of all, on the basis of
                  its appearance. Its somewhat old-fashioned decoration in slip
                  (liquid clay) attests to stylistic conservatism in
                  Staffordshire, the place of its manufacture. Yet if we inquire
                  further, we might find that the mug was implicated in new
                  networks of distribution. The materials used to make it may
                  have been sourced from far away, and the finished object sold
                  in a distant city, or even abroad in America and Europe.

                  We might ask where and how the mug was used. Through the
                  comparative study of objects like this one we can learn about
                  communal drinking habits, the emergence of new venues for
                  socialization, and attitudes towards intoxication. Or we might
                  wonder about the significance of its date inscription, which
                  would lead to questions about attitudes to marriage,
                  childbirth, or political commemoration. The mug would probably
                  have been used across a broad spectrum of society, from the
                  âplainer sortsâ to the upwardly mobile mercantile class. This
                  is a further advantage of object-led research: it often yields
                  evidence of a wider demographic range than textual sources do.
                  In periods where many people were illiterate or semi-literate,
                  or where documents are scarce, objects can often be the only
                  means of accessing the experience of the majority of people â
                  people whose descendants now form a core audience for museum
                  displays and popular histories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite all these benefits, object-based research also poses
                  its own challenges. First and foremost, though museum
                  collections are often defined by the goal of preservation,
                  researchers are forced to think about the objects they hold as
                  dynamic. Unlike most textual forms of historic evidence,
                  material things are subject to constant change through
                  modification, wear and repair. Though authenticity and
                  originality are prized, the fact is that when it comes to
                  objects from the past, alteration is the norm, not the
                  exception.

                  Museum-based conservation offers a disciplinary basis for
                  research into such issues. The techniques of the scientist and
                  the conservator can be used to gain access not only to the
                  moment of an objectâs creation, but also its entire lifespan:
                  a principle that lies at the heart of the V&amp;Aâs recent
                  research project focusing on the Mazarin Chest (funded by the
                  Getty Foundation and the Toshiba International Foundation,
                  supported by the Japan Foundation and the Tobunken, and
                  carried out at the V&amp;A, Imperial College, Loughborough
                  University, Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and the Institute of
                  Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences).
                  The chest is a most unusual example of seventeenth-century
                  Japanese lacquerwork, of a very high quality that would
                  normally not have been exported to Europe. Its history of
                  ownership permits us to see it in relation to a long series of
                  people and places â from its Japanese makers to its initial
                  owners, the Mazarin family of France, from the Romantic-era
                  collector William Beckford, to the V&amp;A itself (the museum
                  acquired the object in 1882).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mazarin Chest project also shed light on differing
                  cultural attitudes to historic objects in the present day. The
                  goal was to develop an integrated approach to the conservation
                  of lacquer objects that respects both western conservation
                  ethics, in which concern with the re-treatability of objects
                  is paramount, and Japanese conservation values, which seek to
                  preserve the cultural continuity of objects by employing, as
                  far as possible, materials and techniques similar to those
                  used at the time of manufacture. The chest has thus been a
                  basis not only for nuanced historic research but also new
                  international exchanges of knowledge and understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A final advantage of object-led research is its direct
                  connection to physical experience. Every researcher who has
                  worked in a museum knows that handling unfamiliar objects for
                  the first time is among the most thrilling aspects of their
                  work. This excitement is telling us something: through touch,
                  we can begin to ask new questions about those different from
                  ourselves. For those interested in issues such as comportment,
                  the senses, and sexual and ethnic identity, materiality can
                  provide routes into unspoken (and perhaps even unconscious)
                  cultural values. Fashion â a subject to which we will return â
                  is a particularly obvious example. Thinking about the
                  self-regulating function of garments, from the kimono to the
                  corset, is an instance in which research can make the lived
                  experience of cultural difference immediately palpable to all.

                <h3>ii. Collections-based research</h3>
                <p>
                  Like the objects which form their content, permanent
                  collections such as those housed at the V&amp;A are not inert.
                  They are a live inheritance that requires constant
                  re-interpretation and new models of communication if they are
                  to speak effectively to contemporary audiences and enhance our
                  sense of the complex, globalised twenty-first-century world as
                  an entity with historical roots and challenging futures.
                  Research is one of the methods by which we realise the social
                  and cultural value of the assets that museums hold on behalf
                  of the public, an obvious point but one that is too rarely
                  made in press coverage and reviews of headline exhibitions and
                  gallery developments. Two current research projects help to
                  elucidate the relevance of our material heritage as
                  represented in the Museumâs collections to the diverse
                  communities of the UK.

                  âFashioning Diaspora Spaceâ is a three-year collaboration
                  between the V&amp;A and Royal Holloway University of London.
                  It is funded by the AHRC as part of the âDiasporas, Identities
                  and Migrationâ Programme and examines the presence in the UK
                  of South Asian (Indian and Pakistani) textiles intended for
                  use in clothing. In the context of the Museum, the project is
                  expanding knowledge about the V&amp;Aâs collections of
                  nineteenth-century Indian textiles, not only in terms of
                  identifying the objects, but also through asking how and why
                  these collections were formed, how they have been used in the
                  past and what they might mean to current and future
                  generations of curators, visitors, designers and consumers.
                  This research is also relevant to the holdings of other museum
                  collections from the City Art Galleries and Whitworth Art
                  Gallery in Manchester, Paisley Museum and Bath Fashion Museum,
                  to the archives of past and present textile manufacturers at
                  Macclesfield Silk Archives, Warners and J&amp;P Baker, as well
                  as to the work of contemporary fashion retailers.In comparing
                  colonial and postcolonial forms, untangling their genesis,
                  their cultural designations and translations, the project has
                  significant implications for our understanding of wider
                  British material and visual cultures and landscapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the earliest groups within the Indian textile
                  collections at the V&amp;A consists of examples acquired at
                  the Great Exhibition of 1851. This was the first time that
                  large numbers of the British public had seen what Indian
                  textile producers were capable of. The quality of Indian hand
                  woven silk, embroideries and muslins was unmatched by
                  industrial British textile manufacturers. In the 1860s and 70s
                  many of the South Asian textiles in the collection were cut up
                  and put into two multi-volume sets of textile sample books.
                  These were sent around the country to both inspire designers
                  and manufacturers, and with a view to building up the sales of
                  British textiles to the Indian subcontinent.Forthcoming
                  entries on the V&amp;A website (the non-destructive equivalent
                  of these nineteenth-century albums)about South Asian textiles
                  in the Museum will make relevant images and information on
                  their history, context and use universally available to a UK
                  (and international) audience for the first time since the
                  middle of the nineteenth century.

                <p>
                  The story of the V&amp;Aâs South Asian textile collection is
                  typical of diaspora narratives, in its mixture of emulation,
                  destruction, and learning. These processes â both positive and
                  negative â are to be found in many other instances of cultural
                  exchange, international trade and migration. Indian textiles,
                  too, include vivid examples of objects whose very surfaces
                  play out the action of far-flung networks in their materials
                  and decoration. The investigation of a distinctive Parsi
                  Chinese embroidery consisting of a coloured embroidery on
                  white silk depicting birds among foliage shaped for a jubla or
                  girlâs shirt reveals longer histories and connections. The
                  Parsis of Bombay (Mumbai) were descendants of the Zoroastrians
                  who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent from Iran in the
                  eighth century. Parsi-owned shipping companies traded with
                  China, returning with highly prized Chinese goods including
                  embroidered textiles. Some Chinese embroiderers also settled
                  in Surat, a port city in Gujarat.This single jubla is thus the
                  complex result of the interwoven histories of four nations in
                  two continents spanning twelve centuries. New interpretations
                  fostered through the focused research of such an object
                  (amongst many others) indicate that it is time to move beyond
                  postcolonial hand wringing and progress in our understanding
                  of a shared human past.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A second example focuses on an aspect of the Museumâs
                  practices where research has revealed a previously overlooked
                  area of the V&amp;Aâs collecting history. The
                  thirty-month-long project, conducted as part of a Cultural
                  Ownership and Capacity Building Project and supported by the
                  Heritage Lottery Fund focuses on identifying and interpreting
                  Africa-related materials within the collections. The
                  undertaking builds on several years of engagement with Black
                  British communities, seeking to build Black and Minority
                  Ethnic audiences for the V&amp;A and to develop collaborations
                  and skill-sharing within the Black heritage/culturalsector.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The V&amp;A has always collected the art and design of Africa.
                  Initially, its collecting focused on the northern part of the
                  continent. Thirteen Tunisian textiles were part of the 1851
                  Great Exhibition purchases which formed the core of the
                  collection. Ancient Egyptian textiles and glassware and
                  Moroccan and Algerian ceramics and jewellery formed other
                  collecting strands through the second half of the nineteenth
                  century and the beginning of the twentieth. This same period
                  witnessed a number of key imperial acquisitions from
                  sub-Saharan Africa including religious, ceremonial and
                  decorative items associated with Ethiopiaâs ruling family
                  acquired through the Abyssinian Expedition of 1868, and
                  thirteen pieces of largely gold regalia, probably associated
                  with the court of the Asante leader, acquired through the
                  British invasion of Kumasi, state capital of Asante, Ghana, in
                  1874.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More recently, these African acquisitions have been
                  supplemented with objects that reflect the changing political,
                  social and cultural contexts of âpostcolonialâ Africa. The
                  Word and Image Department has been particularly active,
                  acquiring prints by African artists including Ben Enwonwu,
                  Tunde Odunlade, Paul Sibisi and David Koloane. The cultural
                  influence of the African diaspora is also represented in
                  acquisitions of work by Caribbean artists such as Winston
                  Branch and Aubrey Williams and Black British artists such as
                  Maud Sulter, Lubaina Himid, Chris Ofili and Faisal AbduâAllah.
                  It is hoped that this fresh, research-informed awareness may
                  fuel revisions to the Museumâs collecting policy and encourage
                  a more proactive, creative approach to its Africa collections
                  and their future development.
                </p>
                <h3>iii. Exhibitions</h3>
                <p>
                  Placed at the crossroads between scholarly enquiry and
                  communication with a wider audience, exhibitions are ideally
                  located to disseminatethe broad cultural, social and economic
                  benefits associated with the arts and humanities field,
                  positively engaging visitors in a much more direct and
                  immersive manner than other forms of media. Unlike other
                  academic outputs, exhibitions must confront the demands of
                  appealing to very large non-specialist audiences while making
                  specialist knowledge widely accessible. This unique set of
                  circumstances makes exhibitions a particularly challenging and
                  stimulating arena within which to explore the value and impact
                  of research.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In recent years, exhibition-based research within the UK has
                  changed dramatically in character and scope. Museums have been
                  at the heart of a momentous cultural shift which has
                  transformed them from perceived passive recipients of
                  research-led initiatives to frontrunners. Fostered by an
                  increasing number of national and international research
                  funding schemes and policies designed to generate active
                  collaborations between museums, universities and colleges,
                  this radical transformation raises important questions about
                  the new character and purpose of exhibition-based research.
                  This is the framework within which the groundbreaking
                  exhibition âAt Home in Renaissance Italyâ (V&amp;A, October
                  2006 â January 2007) â the result of a four-year research
                  project funded by the Getty Foundation and the AHRC
                  -&nbsp;operated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The research leading to an exhibition differs substantially
                  from conventional academic research. Centred on âthingsâ, the
                  research process must acknowledge that objects are carriers of
                  complex visual, material, cultural and social meanings and
                  that as such they should generate multiple narratives and
                  interpretations. This recognition often demands breaking out
                  of traditional disciplinary boundaries and embracing an
                  interdisciplinary outlook. The research for âAt Home in
                  Renaissance Italyâ was carried out by a multi-disciplinary
                  team including scholars working within art, decorative arts
                  and architectural history, social history, Islamic studies,
                  music history, archaeology, the history of science, food
                  history and conservation. Exploring the domestic interior in
                  Italy between 1400 and 1600 in all its visual and material
                  complexity, with objects ranging from prestigious old master
                  paintings and sculpture to pins and pastry cutters, the
                  exhibition brought together for the first time the world of
                  Renaissance âhighâ art and that of domestic material culture.
                  Engaging with household life and everyday experience as well
                  as cultural forms, the exhibition addressed topics as wide
                  ranging as cooking and dining, marriage and childbirth
                  rituals, gambling, music-making, health and hygiene,
                  collecting and mathematical knowledge.

                  The project aimed to make a major new contribution to
                  Renaissance studies and to give revived meaning to the
                  outstanding Renaissance collections housed within the
                  V&amp;A.To achieve these objectives the project maximized its
                  investment in original research by focusing on a wide variety
                  of largely unpublished written documents, visual sources and
                  objects. From domestic inventories to cookery books, from
                  celebrated family portraits to popular prints, from ancient
                  gems to chamber pots, the exhibition revealed a new,
                  multi-faceted aspect to Renaissance art and culture.

                <p>
                  The multiplicity of research methods and exhibits involved in
                  the project was reflected in the narratives accompanying the
                  display, based directly on primary sources, which suggested
                  different, often contrasting interpretations of the same
                  objects. Replacing the traditional authoritative curatorial
                  voice with a more challenging and active approach, this mode
                  of display aimed at including the viewer creatively in the
                  meaning-making process and encouraging a dialogue between
                  specialists and a wider audience.This curatorial strategy
                  meant that there was a direct continuity from the initial
                  framing of research questions all the way to the labels read
                  by members of the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much recent debate has highlighted the widespread
                  dissatisfaction with traditional arenas of social and cultural
                  exchange and the need for alternative spaces for public
                  discourse. As public events and experiences playing a role in
                  the creation of shared meaning, exhibitions can be seen as a
                  largely untapped force for debate and social cohesion.
                  Exhibitions such as âAt Home in Renaissance Italyâ can respond
                  to this demand for public engagement with culture in different
                  ways. By presenting historical materials in an exciting and
                  accessible form they can help to bridge the gap between past
                  and present. By revealing everyday objects, stories or
                  situations that resonate with the life experience of the
                  viewer they can appeal to wider cross-sections of society. By
                  addressing complexity and difference head-on, challenging
                  commonly held assumptions and establishing a dynamic
                  relationship with the viewer, they can provide potent evidence
                  of the value of investing in research into the arts and the
                  humanities.

                <h3>iv. Creativity and design practice</h3>
                <p>
                  Museum-based arts and humanities research also capitalises on
                  and creates multiple connections within the creative
                  industries, making links between practitioners including fine
                  artists, graphic, fashion and 3D designers and craftspeople;
                  manufacturers; scientists; retailers; educators; journalists,
                  publishers and media producers. It encourages debate and
                  collaboration across discrete sectors to their collective
                  benefit and offers an inspirational space in which national
                  conversations about creative skills can take place. In the
                  case of the V&amp;A, research projects focusing on fashion
                  have been particularly successful in generating productive
                  dialogue about this high-profile, multi-million pound industry
                  and its economic, cultural and political meanings and impact.

                  The âShopping Routes: Networks of Fashion Consumption in
                  Londonâs West End 1945 â 1979â project was one such
                  initiative. Jointly hosted by the Geography Department at
                  Royal Holloway, University of London, London College of
                  Fashion and the V&amp;A between 2003 and 2006 as part of the
                  ESRC/AHRCCultures of Consumption Programme, the project had
                  the central aim of providing a new critical history of the
                  development of the West End in the post-war period; widening
                  and complicating existing assumptions, particularly those
                  associated with the powerful myth of âSwinging London.â The
                  project had a series of focused research objectives, seeking
                  to provide an account of the interfaces between designers,
                  manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, urban planners and
                  consumers in the city. It also sought to develop recent ideas
                  about the spatial contexts of fashion consumption, especially
                  those situated in major metropolises, and to enhance
                  understandings of consumption-led processes of urban renewal
                  and transformation. It had the wider aim of interpreting
                  Londonâs role as a major fashion city in a comparative
                  context, by examining the development of a range of key global
                  sites of fashion consumption within a longer time-frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through a combination of cross-institutional and
                  multi-disciplinary approaches, the research succeeded in
                  providing a much more nuanced and extensive history of a
                  phenomenon that hitherto has generally been approached through
                  nostalgic accounts that focused on over-familiar sites like
                  Carnaby Street and the Kingâs Road, and on the emergent
                  celebrity culture of the 1960s. It achieved this in a number
                  of ways. First, archival research pointed to the significance
                  of long-term features of Londonâs fashion landscape, situating
                  the seemingly overnight transformation of the city in the
                  mid-1960s in the context of existing structures of retailing,
                  wholesale, promotion and consumer behaviour, some of which had
                  their roots in the mid-nineteenth century. Secondly, it
                  challenged the existing emphasis on individual designers and
                  boutiques, in favour of a framework that emphasised networks
                  and relationships across sectors and traditions, and
                  identified fashion consumptionâs interactions with other
                  elements of urban change, particularly in architecture,
                  planning and heritage. Thirdly, the project provided a
                  systematic study of the concept of the âFashion World Cityâ,
                  placing the specific characteristics of post-war London in a
                  wider analysis of fashionâs relationship with metropolitan
                  modernity, that continues to have important resonance in the
                  present.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The results of the research were disseminated through a number
                  of channels including books and journal articles. The study of
                  fashion in world cities formed the basis for a major
                  international conference that brought together academics from
                  a wide range of disciplines, and included studies of New York,
                  Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Moscow, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Mumbai
                  to complement the London focus. Most importantly, in 2006 the
                  project was responsible for a high-profile exhibition on
                  âSixties Fashionâ and an associated website at the V&amp;A.
                  This provided an opportunity to test some of the research
                  findings through an engagement with the Museumâs collections,
                  and through collaboration with designers, journalists and
                  retailers active through the 1950s, '60s and '70s. Both
                  display and website, together with an exhibition book, were
                  designed to reach a broad audience and had a demonstrable
                  effect on the popular imagination, drawing positive press
                  comment and informing the content of the UK school curriculum.
                  The website also provided a way of soliciting memories of the
                  period from the public, and a means of disseminating oral
                  history interviews with key designers, entrepreneurs,
                  journalists and others involved in 1960s London.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In general, the project has formed part of a wider
                  re-evaluation of the political, economic and creative legacy
                  of the 1960s that has taken place in UK academic circles and
                  in the popular mediaduring the past two decades. But besides
                  providing an important platform for debate on these
                  retrospective issues, âShopping Routesâ, particularly in its
                  work on fashion and the concept of the World City, also
                  engaged with wider discussion on contemporary urban policy in
                  relation to what has been termed the New Urban Cultural
                  Economy. What this museum-centered research initiative has
                  identified is the extent to which the drive towards symbolic
                  distinctiveness by competing fashion cities needs to be
                  considered alongside the contradictory forces that stifle
                  urban individuality and creativity. These forces include the
                  hyper-capitalisation of property markets and the increasing
                  power of global corporations in a hugely expanded luxury goods
                  sector.History does have something to teach us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the content of the âSixties Fashionâ exhibition suggested,
                  connections between the new symbolic industries (media and
                  advertising) and older craft traditions were much more dynamic
                  in cities like London, New York, Milan and Paris in the 1950s
                  and 1960s, than they were after the massive
                  de-industrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s. The creative
                  networks, flexible production and vibrant consumer cultures of
                  then have been replaced by the corporatised surface sheen of
                  now. So, though âSwinging Londonâ was a small, local affair,
                  its openings for new businesses, its legacy of traditional
                  fashion skills, its affordable infrastructure and its
                  innovative approach to consumerism offers a genuinely
                  distinctive template to those concerned about the serious
                  challenges faced by UK fashion entrepreneurs in the globalised
                  landscape of the early twenty-first century.

                <h3>v. The museum as a forum for cultural exchange</h3>
                <p>
                  Besides functioning as platforms for creative reflection and
                  innovation in relation to the UKâs history and current
                  cultural and economic status, museums are also ideal venues
                  for the staging of new cultural interactions beyond national
                  frontiers. As we have suggested in reference to projects on
                  Japan, South Asia and Africa, because objects themselves have
                  always traversed national boundaries they are therefore a
                  remarkably effective way of studying historical and
                  contemporary cultural exchange. Through intelligent
                  juxtaposition, museums can encourage researchers, curators and
                  the public alike to see both difference and continuity across
                  diverse nationalities, ethnicities, and geographies. This has
                  long been a guiding principle of research at the V&amp;A, and
                  informs permanent displays such as the British Galleries
                  (opened 2001), the Jameel Gallery for Islamic Arts (opened
                  2006), and the new Ceramics Galleries (to open 2009).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The research for two exhibitions, on view this year at the
                  V&amp;A, exemplify this approach. âCold War Modernâ (opened in
                  the Autumn of 2008 and researched in collaboration with
                  colleagues at the University of Brighton and the Royal College
                  of Art) uses the museum platform to reconfigure understandings
                  of international relations in the recent past through the
                  prism of design. Concentrating on the highly volatile years
                  from 1945 to 1975, the exhibition will examine the key themes
                  of the period including the task of reconstruction in Europe
                  after the War and the rise of consumerism, demonstrating a
                  continuity with the themes of Modernism as they emerged in the
                  inter-war years (explored in the V&amp;Aâs âModernism:
                  Designing a New Worldâ exhibition of 2006). The strong
                  influence of the Cold War upon popular culture will be shown
                  through graphics, fashion, film, and product design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rather than focusing exclusively on the two superpowers that
                  formed the poles of Cold War politics (the USA and USSR), the
                  exhibition looks at countries such as Italy, France, Poland
                  and Czechoslovakia, all of which were shaped by the eraâs
                  politics but were not necessarily able to dictate them. The
                  recovery of design history from these contexts unveils complex
                  lines of stylistic and technological exchange. The Soviet
                  satellites of the Eastern Bloc, for example, experimented with
                  surprising intersections between modernism and ideology.
                  Across the projectâs wide geography, art and design during
                  this period played a central role in representing, and
                  sometimes challenging, the dominant ideas of the age.
                </p>
                <p>
                  âChina Design Nowâ, on view at the V&amp;A during the Spring
                  of 2008, was an even more clear-cut example of the Museum as a
                  forum for cultural debate and exchange and a vehicle for truly
                  original research. Based on extensive curatorial field-work
                  carried out in Shenzhen, Shanghai and&nbsp;Beijing over a period of
                  four years, and a three-day research workshop held at the
                  Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing in 2006, the exhibition
                  provided a snapshot of the last ten years of rapid change in
                  Chinaâs creative industries. Despite considerable recent media
                  coverage in the UK (partly due to the upcoming Olympics in
                  Beijing), public understanding of the social and industrial
                  transformations occurring in China is only just starting to
                  take shape. In such a moment there is no substitute for
                  on-the-ground research, and this the V&amp;A has been able to
                  provide in-depth, bringing examples of product, fashion,
                  architectural and graphic design before the British public for
                  the first time. In addition, âChina Design Nowâ offered
                  insights into the dynamics of emergent design professionalism
                  â and thus offers lessons that might well be applied to the
                  study of other places and times.
                </p>
                <h2>Concluding comments</h2>
                <p>
                  These various case studies demonstrate the vibrancy of arts
                  and humanities research undertaken within just one national
                  institution; many othersimilar examples could be cited from
                  the activities of the V&amp;A, and more broadly across the
                  British museum and gallery sector. What positions
                  inter-disciplinary museum-based research in the UK as unique
                  is its innovative focus on material and visual culture as a
                  primary focus for explaining broader cultural, aesthetic,
                  economic and political developments; its openness to
                  cross-institutional and inter-disciplinary research as a means
                  of formulating such explanations; and its extraordinary
                  capacity to further specialist knowledge whilst also informing
                  wider public understanding. There is of course much potential
                  for strengthening the research-base of the UKâs museum sector,
                  not least through further research that demonstrates the
                  essential link between grounded, scholarly investigation of
                  collections and the experience of the visitor. All must agree
                  however, that the simplistic dismissal of museum outputs as
                  âdumbed-downâ versions of academic research â spectacular but
                  empty entertainment â overlooks the tremendous innovation that
                  underlies museum work in the UK today. This research
                  constitutes an example to our international peers, and a major
                  contribution to the intellectual and cultural life of the
                  nation.
