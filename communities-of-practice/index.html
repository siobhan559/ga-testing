                <h2>1&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  The V&amp;A identifies its audience in terms of six
                  definitions of visitor type, which are not mutually exclusive.
                  They are: independent adults, students, families, organised
                  groups, schools and adults from the Creative Industries (CI).
                  Whilst the V&amp;A has a long association, dating back to its
                  foundation, of working with artists and craftspeople, it is
                  only within the last decade that this latter group of visitors
                  has been grouped together under a particular label. Developing
                  an agreed definition of the CI as part of the visitor
                  segmentation post-opening of the British Galleries in 2001 had
                  been somewhat of a struggle, but by 2004 the Museum had a set
                  of six audience definitions, including one for the CI.
                  However, this was an ‘internal’ definition, so to speak, and
                  during the last decade the nature of the CI has become
                  something debated far wider than within the V&amp;A as an
                  institution. The introduction of the term ‘creative
                  industries’ in government language in the late 1990s was the
                  beginning of an attempt to bring unity to a fragmented
                  selection of industries identified as contributing
                  significantly to the British economy. Since then, there have
                  been significant developments in policy aimed at nurturing,
                  benefiting from, and ensuring the continued growth and success
                  of, the Creative Industries. Responsibility for this sector
                  lies nominally within the Department of Culture, Media and
                  Sport (DCMS), but both the Department for Skills and Education
                  (DfES)<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                  and the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI)<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                  have launched initiatives and commissioned reports
                  investigating the growth of the creative industries sector.
                  The Cox Report, a review of creativity and design in UK
                  business, was published in December 2005.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                  One of the objectives set out in the V&amp;A’s 2007–2012
                  Strategic Plan is, ‘to promote, support and develop the UK
                  creative economy by inspiring designers and makers and by
                  stimulating enjoyment and appreciation of design’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In response to this, and as part of a long-term programme to
                  revisit the definitions of its six visitor categories, in 2006
                  the Head of Gallery Interpretation, Evaluation and Resources
                  at the V&amp;A launched a research project aiming to redefine
                  the V&amp;A’s audience segmentation description of the CI.
                  After an initial literature review was conducted, data was
                  collected over the course of nine months and consisted of
                  three phases:

                  The findings from this research project were extensive and
                  complex. This short article will present one aspect only of
                  the findings, which is an exploration of the appropriateness
                  or otherwise of considering the CI in terms of a community of
                  practice. Within the terms of the research, it was necessary
                  to establish this before going on to consider the findings in
                  terms of the nature of the relationship between the CI and the
                  V&amp;A. These latter findings will be presented in a further
                  paper to be submitted to the V&amp;A journal at a future date.
                </p>
                <h2>2&nbsp;Defining the Creative Industries</h2>
                <p>
                  It was first necessary to identify current definitions for the
                  CI in a wider context external to the Museum. The literature
                  review looked at government publications and reports related
                  to the CI, and explored a number of agencies and forums that
                  have been set up to service the CI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were several findings with direct implications for
                  V&amp;A thinking about CI visitors. The first was that they
                  include those not actually involved in a creative occupation
                  themselves (e.g. an accountant at a design agency) and those
                  involved in a creative occupation but not actually working in
                  a creative industry (e.g. an in-house designer working for a
                  city firm). This type of definition dates back to early
                  thinking about the CI, such as the 1998 report ‘Creative
                  Britain’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second finding was the inclusion, by agencies such as the
                  Creative Industries Task Force,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                  of industries where creative processes are utilised. Therefore
                  the CI in their broadest spectrum are considered to consist
                  not just of’core’ industries with obvious creative output but
                  also industries employing ‘creative strategies’. These are
                  termed ‘related’ industries and activities and are included in
                  all government strategies for the CI. These first two findings
                  can be said to form a spectrum of ‘creative activity’ ranging
                  across a variety of type and depth of engagement with creative
                  practice in people’s work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The third significant finding was that, despite much
                  discussion about the potential educational and social benefits
                  to be gained from nurturing the CI in the UK, ultimately
                  economic benefit to the UK is the primary outcome Government
                  Departments responsible for CI initiatives are interested in,
                  as emphasised in the 2006 report by the Entrepreneurship and
                  Skills Task Group (ESTG).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, and in notable contrast, it was found that that many
                  elements within the CI sector do not necessarily label
                  themselves as such. The literature review looked at current
                  magazines and journals associated with sectors identified
                  under CI, such as “Blueprint”, “Crafts”, “Design History
                  Newsletter” and “Frieze”, and found that there was little or
                  no reference to the CI. It also is worth noting that the
                  Office of National Statistics, in a recent publication of
                  figures of the UK workforce segmented by industry, does not
                  have a separate segment for the Creative Industries.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The broad ‘creative activity spectrum’ identified has
                  attendant issues for anyone interested in working with the CI,
                  and particularly for this research project, because of the
                  enormous variation of scope and activity within the unit of
                  study. This makes it a challenging sector in terms of visitor
                  profiling for the V&amp;A.

                <h2>3&nbsp;Communities of Practice</h2>
                <p>
                  Given the issues in defining the CI, the researchers used
                  Wenger and Lave’s ‘Communities of Practice’ methodology as a
                  framework to define the research.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  ‘Communities of Practice’ is grounded in sociological theory
                  of practical knowledge, and pedagogical theories of situated
                  and social learning. It aims to identify groups of people
                  bound together through knowledge, and is based on a definition
                  of knowledge that includes tacit knowledge that is shared
                  informally through human interaction processes such as
                  storytelling, conversation and coaching or mentoring. Their
                  greatest value lies in intangible outcomes, such as the
                  relationships they build among people, the sense of belonging
                  they create, the spirit of inquiry they generate, and the
                  professional confidence and identity they confer to their
                  members.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, ‘Communities of Practice’ also acknowledges that this
                  shared knowledge is dynamic: constantly changed, transformed
                  and updated through these same processes. Members spend little
                  time on searching for solutions to short-term problems because
                  they can get access to help or immediate solutions quickly
                  through their community or communities. Members are also more
                  likely to take risks as they feel they have back up and
                  support from the community of practice. This has the
                  intangible outcome of a sense of trust, which in turn has a
                  tangible outcome of an increased ability to innovate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are three indicators of structure for a community of
                  practice:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    A domain of knowledge with a defined set of issues, which
                    creates common ground and a sense of common identity. The
                    domain also inspires contribution and participation.
                    However, it requires participants to know its boundaries, in
                    order for members to be able to present ideas and pursue
                    common activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A community that creates a social context for learning. The
                    community interacts and fosters relationships based on
                    respect and trust. An effective community of practice
                    handles dissent productively. Members are able to share
                    ideas, expose ignorance and ask difficult questions. This
                    interaction fosters learning and also a sense of belonging
                    and commitment. However, members remain individual not
                    homogenous, and develop their own specialities and styles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A practice consisting of a framework of shared ideas, tools,
                    information, language, stories and documents. This forms the
                    basic knowledge of the community that all members share and
                    from which development and innovation can spring.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup></strong>

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Exploring potential indicators of a domain indicating a
                  community of practice, the following shared issues were found
                  to be consistent within the CI:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The <strong>design challenge</strong>: pushing boundaries in
                    all areas of practice, e.g. working with new materials such
                    as casting glass in microwaves, ‘using new technologies and
                    integrating them into the craft process’ (Jeweller).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The <strong>business environment</strong>: participants made
                    very clear choices about assuring at least a base level of
                    income. This was perhaps not their ideal practice, but freed
                    them in their other time to follow their own practice, as
                    ‘the idea really is that we can say no to jobs that we don’t
                    want to do rather than just having to take everything on’
                    (Architect); the practical motivation for this work did not
                    mean they would compromise on quality.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Validation through
                    <strong>peer and commercial success</strong>. Participants
                    were very concerned about making the right product for the
                    right audience.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Validation through <strong>‘client’ feedback</strong>. This
                    was particularly so at the initiator end of the spectrum, as
                    for example an auction house director felt ‘well we are
                    seeing it from the sales but we get good feedback, we have
                    had excellent feedback from things but the great thing about
                    (x) is that you can see whether something is working, you
                    can get a good feel for if something’s working from the
                    results of the sales’.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Personal ambition</strong>: the need to constantly
                    push further. The jeweller disciplined herself to do one
                    collection per year&nbsp;during the summer to ‘prove to the
                    outside world that I can still do it’ (Jeweller).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Risk taking and innovation</strong>: a key
                    motivation and widely recognised indicator of creativity
                    across the spectrum, which encouraged innovation because
                    ‘you don’t hit brick walls because probably our sheer
                    audacity is doing something that people haven’t thought of
                    doing before’ (Publisher).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enjoying <strong>problem solving</strong>, rather than
                    seeing problems as blocks to success. A jeweller highly
                    enjoyed and valued this, saying ‘it comes very naturally to
                    me, problem solving on the spot’.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For a majority of makers, but significantly less so for
                    initiators, an <strong>academic research</strong> element
                    and formal education was integral to the domain. A textiles
                    designer particularly emphasised that ‘for me educating is
                    the consequence of the experience as a designer and I think
                    that if I stop designing … I’m not saying that I won’t have
                    stuff to give, but in a way that was the process for how I
                    came to education … I think it’s a two-way flow and I think
                    that has to keep going, if you’re going to be effective’.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Quality control</strong>: performed informally
                    through peer-review and self-discipline.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The above are issues that work well as a shared domain within
                  the communities of practice framework, and during the data
                  collection, particularly in-depth interviews, participants
                  themselves also identified some of these indicators as shared
                  across different creative disciplines. A publisher articulated
                  this as being creative skill rather than specifically
                  discipline-related: ‘if you have the medium then you apply
                  that medium, that skill to whatever you are supposed to be
                  creating but the creation process I think is equal across the
                  board in the creative world’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This research found that nature of the CI domain, as
                  identified through the indicators described above, makes this
                  community of practice more than a set of relationships and
                  goes some way to giving it an agreed identity. This identity
                  fosters commitment to care for the domain, and makes the CI a
                  community of practice, more than a collection of individuals
                  with an informal communication network. However, it was
                  fragile and there was constant flux within this domain. For
                  some participants this was a source of anxiety as well as
                  challenge, because ‘it’s an industry that changes constantly,
                  it’s very easy to fall behind and not be aware of current
                  activities that are part of the working environment’ (Textiles
                  designer).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Looking at the nature of the ‘community’ within the CI, this
                  research found that the network was primarily how people
                  across the entire spectrum tried out new
                  <strong>ideas</strong>, and tested them. A publisher described
                  ‘you know everybody comes up with bad ideas but luckily there
                  is a good filtering process. The more people you talk to, you
                  can weed all those out before they get any further and cost a
                  lot in development’. Within the community, creativity itself
                  was described predominantly in terms of a
                  <strong>process</strong>, that ‘creativity is the thought
                  process needed to produce or provide’ an identified outcome
                  (Jeweller). Notably, at the maker end of the spectrum, people
                  defined themselves as academics and had planned to do so, as a
                  jeweller recalled: ‘I had applied also already for the RCA
                  because I wanted to become a teacher really, that was always
                  my plan’. This was part of a desire to pass on skills and
                  intangible knowledge gathered during
                  <strong>experience</strong>, not just in terms of creative
                  skills but also business skills, considered vital: ‘I wanted
                  to feed that back, to channel it back in to younger people to
                  fast-track their experiences in a lot of ways through the
                  experience that I’d had and transmitting those to someone, so
                  that they didn’t have to go through the same experience to an
                  extent. That they could accumulate that, based on someone
                  else’s experience, that had gone before’ (Textiles designer).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Often, the aim of working in the CI was a vocation the
                  participant was aware of from an early age, for example a
                  theatre director who said ‘I have a feeling that I have been
                  working towards it all my life’. Surprisingly, being creative
                  was actually seen as only a small part of the criteria for
                  professional success. However, it was the kernel that made all
                  the difference to their enjoyment of work, as ‘it’s the idea
                  to go back and be able to talk about ideas and spend hours in
                  a whole day talking to people about ideas and process and
                  values and that’s a great luxury’ (Architect). It is this
                  luxury that allowed participants to <strong>innovate</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mentors played an important role, even during relatively
                  unfocussed times of early professional development. This
                  ranged from sensing a feeling of empathy with like-minded
                  people, to meeting someone particularly inspiring and
                  nurturing. A publisher described: ‘I was picked up by a
                  brilliant Dutch designer from Pentagram. He liked my attitude,
                  I think it was very similar to his and really he gave me an
                  apprenticeship which I am so grateful for’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, <strong>collaboration</strong> with others was
                  critical as a way of participants finding their path in the
                  community. Across the data, people described themselves as
                  part of a chain within which they maintained their individual
                  aspect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The community factor within a community of practice should be
                  essentially a network of relationships that allows exchange of
                  ideas and risk-taking within a safe, non-judgemental
                  environment. The network of relationships in the CI found
                  amongst participants was based on five common elements:
                  <strong>ideas, process, experience, innovation, and
                    collaboration</strong>. This gives confidence to its members. Members are able to
                  take risks and expose themselves to failure because there is
                  no ‘hierarchy’ within the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The research found that the community network is well
                  established within individual disciplines, but less so across
                  the whole Creative Activity Spectrum. The shared issues
                  identified above are not specific enough to coalesce to form a
                  domain that works across differing disciplines within the
                  community. The lack of these defined boundaries, affecting the
                  community network, is possibly an issue that contributes to a
                  lack of self-identification of the CI with the UK Government
                  concept of CI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘Practice’, the third indicator of a community of practice,
                  was important for the CI across the spectrum. It was the area
                  where the research identified the most unifying factors, for
                  example the huge proportion of participants who read
                  The&nbsp;Guardian (82.9% of on-line participants). Within practice,
                  the notion of a spectrum of process and practice came through
                  strongly. However, it was also where the most complex debate
                  around the nature of creativity itself occurred. Many
                  participants spent a long time in discussion through the
                  various data collection methods considering creativity, but
                  one jeweller summarised the open-ended nature of the debate by
                  saying ‘creativity is easy to assume, but not so to define.
                  The concept is wide open depending on its context and it would
                  be unwise to be so reductive’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An issue that came up many times was the importance not just
                  of design and practical skills, but also of understanding how
                  to negotiate the field. The need to ‘understand the
                  professional, the profession and your role within the
                  profession’ (Textiles designer) was critical to people’s sense
                  of professional identity. A significant skill was the ability
                  to see a concept through to production, requiring project
                  management and people skills. Being able to foster and
                  maintain an original concept through this was seen to be the
                  ultimate in definitions of creativity. ‘For it [the final
                  output] to resemble what you had in mind in the first place is
                  another great leap’ (Architect).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was reflected in the workplaces that were visited as part
                  of the ethnographic data collection. For the most part open
                  plan, sometimes with specific work areas allocated to tasks
                  rather than specific people, all were extremely well organised
                  and had areas where the ‘bones’ of projects being worked on
                  were exposed. For example, the textiles designer was very
                  clear about separation between what he called ‘the workplace’,
                  which is the commercial production environment for textiles,
                  and the ‘educational environment’ which is for teaching, even
                  though physically there may not have been a difference to the
                  untutored eye. All participants talked about cycles of working
                  practice they had developed to ensure multiple project
                  management. An auction house Director described himself almost
                  as the eye of the storm: ‘My job is to make sure that it all
                  comes together in a timely fashion and I also work to pull the
                  images together so I can let all these people know, certainly
                  from the creative side of things’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Participants felt that their chosen area of design was a
                  matter of application rather than vocation, although working
                  generally in the CI field was a vocation. A ceramicist
                  described herself as a visual artist who predominantly works
                  in clay; a textiles designer had started off training as a
                  ceramicist. This was not just a matter of the type of output
                  but applying creativity across a whole range of skills, as a
                  theatre director described: ‘certainly I would advocate that
                  now people are much more, you know you’re not trained just to
                  be an actress, just to be this, just to be that, and that
                  there is something creative entrepreneur, cultural
                  entrepreneur, a real subject … you have a much broader view of
                  what you could do’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Participants were not necessarily specifically formally
                  trained but nearly all mentioned informal continuing
                  development (90.8% of on-line participants). Notably, at the
                  maker end of the creative activity spectrum, participants had
                  been engaging with their creative practice from a very early
                  age. By the time they were ‘mid-career’ professionals they
                  could easily have been working in various creative disciplines
                  for twenty-five years. This meant that students were already
                  viewed as professionals even by their tutors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Collaboration in the community was about working as an
                  individual within a collective, with ‘like-minded people’
                  rather than in the same discipline. The need to retain
                  individuality was directly related to professional ego, as a
                  textiles designer described: ‘I’m happy to work like that in
                  my own design field and then go out and discuss but actually
                  the design process is a quite personal one’. However, in
                  contrast to feelings about collaboration, ambition and
                  self-promotion came through strongly in terms of
                  self-discipline. This combination of seemingly conflicting
                  factors resulted in a key indicator of the CI community of
                  practice, which was that all the participants were very adept
                  at analysing their own strengths and weaknesses and using
                  collaboration to address them. They were therefore good at
                  finding people with the right skills and knowledge to help
                  them achieve the ‘vision’ of their practice. A publisher
                  described using his network for this: ‘I like people who come
                  up and can be incredibly resourceful, can realise something
                  while still being really resourceful and that is why I like to
                  employ people with a lot of contacts who have worked in and
                  around the creative field’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seemed that the primary shared feature of practice was the
                  interest in process rather than product. Whilst people were
                  interested in following their own practice, and organised
                  their work commercially to enable that, they also liked
                  competitions, which they felt set boundaries that challenged
                  their practice and therefore produced better work.
                </p>
                <h2>5&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  This research showed that the Creative Industries closely
                  resemble a community of practice. A notion of a spectrum of
                  creative activity from initiators to makers emerged, and
                  elements within the domain, community and practice varied
                  slightly according to where participants sat on the spectrum.
                  Across the whole spectrum, but noticeably with makers, the
                  idea of creative industry was seen as something applicable
                  across many disciplines. There was very strong
                  self-identification for makers from an early age, which was
                  not necessarily related to the stage of formal training they
                  may have participated in. This was in part because creativity
                  was seen much more as a process than a product, but also
                  because people were very aware of their own strengths and
                  weaknesses, and viewed collaboration as key to addressing
                  them. This was balanced with an awareness of their own
                  individual skill and unique selling points. Informal
                  recommendation and word of mouth led to the most successful
                  collaboration. Contrary to a generalised view of people who
                  are ‘creative’, commercial success was more important than
                  commonly assumed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The creative activity spectrum identified in the research can
                  be thought of as relating to the intellectual property of
                  creative process, as well as to creative production.
                  Significantly, the former can happen without a notably
                  ‘creative’ output, but with a notably creative outcome, which
                  is what the DCMS was particularly interested in cultivating to
                  encourage economic success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Wenger, the most successful communities of
                  practice thrive where the goals and needs of an organisation
                  intersect with the passions and aspirations of participants.
                  If the domain of a community fails to inspire its members, the
                  community will flounder.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>
                  However, in this case the domain of shared issues was the
                  weakest of the three indicators. The community was strong but
                  with fuzzy boundaries, and the practice was most defined. For
                  the V&amp;A, this means that it is extremely challenging to
                  nurture a relationship between the CI and the Museum which
                  both contributes to V&amp;A objectives and could also be
                  proven to contribute to Government objectives. Furthermore,
                  and most challenging for the V&amp;A, is the great difference
                  between Government thinking about the CI and thinking within
                  those industries themselves. However, the benefits of the
                  V&amp;A considering the CI as a community of practice is in
                  the potential the Museum could have to contribute not only to
                  the knowledge management of the CI, the domain, but also to
                  the practice that applies to this knowledge management.
